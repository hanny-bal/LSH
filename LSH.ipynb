    "A $k$-shingle for a document is a sequence of $k$ tokens that appears in the document. In our case, the tokens will be characters. With the help of shingling, we can represent a document as the set of contained $k$-shingles. This way, the ordering of words (and some context) is preserved. To compress the size of individual shingles, it makes sense to hash them to an integer value, e.g. of 4 bytes."
